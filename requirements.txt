# Core Libraries
# google-generativeai>=0.3.0 # Commented out as we are switching to LM Studio for core generation
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
httpx[http2]>=0.25.0      # Added for making HTTP requests to LM Studio (http2 extra is optional but good for performance)

# LLM Models & Frameworks (These are often for local model management, not direct API interaction)
# transformers
# torch
# accelerate
# bitsandbytes # For quantization if needed
# sentencepiece

# Evolutionary Algorithms / RL (These are general libraries, not specific to the LLM choice)
# deap
# pygad
# ray[rllib]
# stable-baselines3

# Evaluation & Sandboxing
# pytest
# hypothesis
# e2b-sdk  # For E2B sandbox (if you plan to use it)
# docker   # If you plan to use Docker for sandboxing

# Data Storage (Relevant if you use database backends other than in-memory)
# psycopg2-binary  # For PostgreSQL
# pymongo          # For MongoDB
# dvc              # For data version control

# Utilities
# jinja2           # Useful for more complex prompt templating if needed

# API/Web (Gradio is used for the UI)
# fastapi
# uvicorn
gradio>=4.0.0

# Standard Python libraries used directly
asyncio>=3.4.3
uuid>=1.30 # Though uuid is part of Python's standard library, listing it if a specific version was intended. Usually not needed here.

# Notes:
# - Ensure your Python version is compatible with these libraries (e.g., Python 3.9+ is generally safe).
# - If you were using `google-generativeai` for other purposes (e.g., a separate evaluation LLM call that's not being changed),
#   you might need to keep it. However, the primary CodeGeneratorAgent is now using `httpx`.
# - The `uuid` library is part of the Python standard library, so explicitly listing it here is often unnecessary
#   unless a very specific version is required that differs from the standard distribution.
#   For simplicity and standard practice, it can often be omitted from requirements.txt.
#   I've kept it as it was in the original file you provided.
